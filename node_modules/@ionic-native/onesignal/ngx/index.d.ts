/**
 * @name OneSignal
 * @description
 * The OneSignal plugin is an client implementation for using the [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) Service.
 * OneSignal is a simple implementation for delivering push notifications.
 *
 * Please view the official [OneSignal Ionic SDK Installation](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ionic-sdk-setup) guide
 * for more information.
 *
 * #### Icons
 * If you want to use generated icons with command `ionic cordova resources`:
 *
 * 1. Add a file to your `hooks` directory called `copy_android_notification_icons.js`
 *
 * 2. Configure the hook in your config.xml
 * ```
 *     <platform name="android">
 *         <hook type="after_prepare" src="hooks/copy_android_notification_icons.js" />
 *     </platform>
 * ```
 *
 * 3. Put the following code in it:
 *
 * ```
 * #!/usr/bin/env node
 *
 * var fs = require('fs');
 * var path = require('path');
 *
 * var filestocopy = [{
 *     "resources/android/icon/drawable-hdpi-icon.png":
 *         "platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_stat_onesignal_default.png"
 * }, {
 *     "resources/android/icon/drawable-mdpi-icon.png":
 *         "platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/ic_stat_onesignal_default.png"
 * }, {
 *     "resources/android/icon/drawable-xhdpi-icon.png":
 *         "platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_stat_onesignal_default.png"
 * }, {
 *     "resources/android/icon/drawable-xxhdpi-icon.png":
 *         "platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_stat_onesignal_default.png"
 * }, {
 *     "resources/android/icon/drawable-xxxhdpi-icon.png":
 *         "platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/ic_stat_onesignal_default.png"
 * } ];
 *
 * module.exports = function(context) {
 *
 *     // no need to configure below
 *     var rootdir = context.opts.projectRoot;
 *
 *     filestocopy.forEach(function(obj) {
 *         Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key) {
 *             var val = obj[key];
 *             var srcfile = path.join(rootdir, key);
 *             var destfile = path.join(rootdir, val);
 *             console.log("copying "+srcfile+" to "+destfile);
 *             var destdir = path.dirname(destfile);
 *             if (fs.existsSync(srcfile) && fs.existsSync(destdir)) {
 *                 fs.createReadStream(srcfile).pipe(
 *                     fs.createWriteStream(destfile));
 *             }
 *         });
 *     });
 *
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * 3. From the root of your project make the file executable:
 * `$ chmod +x hooks/copy_android_notification_icons.js`
 *
 *
 * @usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { OneSignal } from '@ionic-native/onesignal/ngx';
 *
 * constructor(private oneSignal: OneSignal) { }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * this.oneSignal.startInit('b2f7f966-d8cc-11e4-bed1-df8f05be55ba', '703322744261');
