## Overview of this folder.

We use onesignal notification library to push notifications to phones. Onesignal is a great library and it is widely used. 
However, a limitation of onesignal is, it doesn't provide anyway to track notifications (when notification was
received, and when notification was clicked). 

The files in this folder provide extra code to track these notifications.


## Steps to install the files on iOS and Andriod


### Android
