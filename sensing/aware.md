# MVP for sleep sensing

Participants need to follow a two-step process to join the The MVP version of sleep tracking: (i) install the Aware app on the phone, (ii) join the study by scanning a QR code. These two steps are described below.

## Step #1: Installing AWARE app on the phone


AWARE is a popular sensor data collection platform that is widely used. The installation instructions are different for the Android and iOS as described below. 


### iOS
Open the 'App Store' app on your phone and search "Aware." The correct version of the app is "AWARE Client V2". Install the app.  


### Android
Android version of AWARE isn't available in the android play store and can be only downloaded from the aware framework's website as an apk (apk's are android's executatble file fomrat). The exact steps to install the apk are below:

1. There are two methods to install the apk: 

     
     - **Method 1 (easier)**: Click on this [link](http://jenkins.awareframework.com/job/com.aware.phone/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/aware-phone/build/outputs/apk/release/aware-phone-armeabi-release.apk) to download the **apk** from AWARE website. 
     - **Method 2**: Go to AWARE website [awareframework.com](https://awareframework.com/) and scroll down to find the link for `AWARE for Android`.  

2. Android OS may ask to enable the installation of apks from **unknown sources**. Android is asking this because the apk is not distributed through the play store, so Google can't verify if the app obeys all app store rules and is not malicous. AWARE isn't a malicious app, but it uses some permissions for background recording that Google recently disabled. The official statement from AWARE website is the following:

    > *You wonâ€™t find AWARE on the Google Play Store. Being an application to conduct user-studies, we use many permissions that current developer guidelines do not allow. We are now hosting the client. This allows us to provide you with the tool you are used to without restrictions and allows us to better support the platform going forward.*

## Step #2: Joining the sleep study
We have already configured a study for the Harvard component of SARA. The study data is currently located in a MySQL database hosted in an Amazon EC2 machine.

Steps to join this study is the following:
- Open the aware app. Right at the top you'll see a QR code icon.
- Scan the following **QR** code. The app will automatically ask you to join the study called `aware-sara-harvard`.

- Once the study is configured, the icon at the top of the app will change. 
- At the top of the app, you will see a `Device ID`. The device ID is required to separte one user's data from another. Please send us the first 8 digits of the device id (highlighed in green in the following image).
